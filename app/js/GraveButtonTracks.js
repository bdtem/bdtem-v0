And people of the future will look on us as the past and be surprised that we thought the same way as them even so far back as now. And none of it will seem so different, and no one will have any new ideas, except that everyone will be living only for the first time. Each ancient truth will have to be relearned by each future person, one by one, in order of simplicity. Because it is difficult to grasp these truths, because we keep layering them with falsities, so that we have to learn so many obvious things before we realize that we already know what we need to know.",
