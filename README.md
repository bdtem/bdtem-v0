// TODO FOR THE FIRST SITE VERSION //
------------------------------------

// MUST DO:

- Buy domain name(s)

Box:
- Get the updated song titles / tracks
- Finish linking up the 'box links' to the desired actions

Link Buttons:
- Link up all the top-right buttons to the desired actions
- Position the links and the shield away from edges
- Link all the buttons to the real things
- Make info video or use a placeholder video
- Set up accounts for link buttons (newsletter sign-up; contact info (emails, etc.); social media; paypal; 

Metadata Popup
- Finish the metadata popup configuration
- Add metadata (name, cat. #, description)

Style:
- Extract all that nasty in-line CSS to the .less files + class up those divs.
- Correctly position / size 'the box' within the page
- Polish up the transport bar
- Get / position the updated background image
- Finalize design for seek bar
-Compare design with Tyler's original mock-up to see if we are forgetting/missing anything aesthetically
- Move the buttons to the bottom right (maybe move the shield, too?)
- Style metadata popup


// NICE TO DO:

- Test the site on other browsers / resolutions / screen sizes to make sure positioning etc doesn't get effed up
- Get that totally sweet generated static effect in the background instead of depending on GIF artifacts
- Find a way to properly include 'the box' from external source rather than keeping it in-line (or, more generally, de-clutter index.html by extracting code)
