// TODO FOR THE FIRST SITE VERSION //
------------------------------------

// MUST DO:

Box:

- Get the updated tracks
- Finish linking up the 'box links' to the desired actions

Link Buttons:

- Link up all the top-right buttons to the desired actions
- Position the links away from edges
- Use the new top-right icons
- Add animation to top-right icons
- Make info video or use a placeholder video

Metadata Popup

- Finish the metadata popup configuration
- Add metadata (name, cat. #, description)

Style:

- Extract all that nasty in-line CSS to the .less files + class up those divs.
- Correctly position / size 'the box' within the page
- Polish up the transport bar
- Get / position the updated background image


// NICE TO DO:

- Test the site on other browsers / resolutions / screen sizes to make sure positioning etc doesn't get effed up
- Get that totally sweet generated static effect in the background instead of depending on GIF artifacts
- Find a way to properly include 'the box' from external source rather than keeping it in-line (or, more generally, de-clutter index.html by extracting code)
